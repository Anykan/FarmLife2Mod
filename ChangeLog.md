# FarmLife2Mod 1.0.0

Farm Life v2 is finally out!

[FAQs](https://github.com/stasis78/FarmLife2Mod/blob/master/FAQs.md)

[What is Farm Life?][https://github.com/stasis78/FarmLife2Mod/blob/master/FarmLifeMod.md]

## Changed

Since version v1.8.0 there are too many changes to list. Most of the old items/blocks/recipes survived in one way shape or form. However things have changed quite a bit. Here are some highlights

- Brewing and spirits now require different types of malts and grain. 
- Malting is now more complex.
- Almost every recipe requires a craft station or tool.
- Dynamic economy. Items are rated based on what it took to make them.
- Dynamic food and water. Every item gives more food and water depending on what it took to cook it up.
- Dynamic Quests. Complicated recipes have a quest to gather materials up front before cooking.
- Dynamic Buffs. Most food and water that is crafted now has a buff. Some are hand crafted but many are now procedurally generated. I recommend exploring all the buffs to see what they do, there are some really powerful ones :)


## New Stuff

Here are some highlights:

- Chopping Board

The Chopping Board is a primary tool for the kitchen. You will need it for many of the recipes new.

- Fermentor Bench

With the addition of fermentation to food, there is now a special crafting station used for aging foods. It iss a must have for things like Cheese and Sauerkraut.

## Notes

It has been a really long road but finally got this sucker out. Special thanks again to Syn for the awesome models on most of the crafting stations :)

## Ok so now what? Are you done?

Nope. I will now be focused on adding more content and plant models. There are a fair bit of new things in this mod that should keep you busy for a month or so. Meanwhile I will continue work on awesome new content and quests :D


# FarmLife2Mod 0.0.1

Test build. Lots of new things have been added since the final release of FarmLifeMod 1.8.0.

## Changed

Too many things to list.

## New Stuff

WAAAAY too many things to list.

## Notes

All livestock now uses custom models.

All crafting stations except for the Wood Grill and Fermentor Bench have custom models.

All items that are not recipe steps now have custom icons.

There are several new craft stations to explore. The "Chopping Board" is a very important tool now but you'll need to grow some trees and gather materials before you can make one. Quest coming to solve this issue.

## What does 'Test build' mean exactly?

This is basically a pre-released version of the mod. It has been "kinda tested" but will definitely have bugs and weird stuff.

I do not recommend using this for a serious map. A real full playable version is coming, really soon :)
