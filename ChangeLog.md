# FarmLife2Mod 0.0.1

Test build. Lots of new things have been added since the final release of FarmLifeMod 1.8.0.

## Changed

Too many things to list.

## New Stuff

WAAAAY too many things to list.

## Notes

All livestock now uses custom models.

All crafting stations except for the Wood Grill and Fermentor Bench have custom models.

All items that are not recipe steps now have custom icons.

There are several new craft stations to explore. The "Chopping Board" is a very important tool now but you'll need to grow some trees and gather materials before you can make one. Quest coming to solve this issue.

## What does 'Test build' mean exactly?

This is basically a pre-released version of the mod. It has been "kinda tested" but will definitely have bugs and weird stuff.

I do not recommend using this for a serious map. A real full playable version is coming, really soon :)
