# Installation

To install FarmLife2Mod you *must* copy it into your `Mods` folder. Locations for `Mods` folders:

- [Mac OS X](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?101570-modlets-on-Mac)
- [Windows](https://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/How_to_Install_Modlets)

### Localizations

Localization strings are available for Farm Life. The changes must be manually applied.

#### On Mac

- Find and open the `Localization.txt` file at this path.

    "~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/7 Days To Die/7DaysToDie.app/Data/Config"
    
- Open the `Localization.txt` file from `FarmLife2Mod/Localization.txt`
- Copy all the contents of `FarmLife2Mod/Localization.txt`
- Paste them at the end of the `7DaysToDie.app/Data/Config/Localization.txt`
- Save changes to `7DaysToDie.app/Data/Config/Localization.txt`


#### On Windows

I have only tested this with Notepad++. Do **not** use the default windows text editor.

See [Windows Mod Folder](https://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/How_to_Install_Modlets) to find the path to the game

- Find and open the `Localization.txt` file in your game folder under `Data\Config`
- Open the `Localization.txt` file from `FarmLife2Mod/Localization.txt`
- Copy all the contents of `FarmLife2Mod\Localization.txt`
- Paste them at the end of the `Data\Config\Localization.txt`
- Save changes to `Data\Config\Localization.txt`
