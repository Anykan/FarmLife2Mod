These are frequently asked questions.

### Recipes too complicated, epic ****ing fail noob modder!

I apologize for the depth and complexity of my mod. Let me try to help!

I have created a markdown file that contains all recipes and links to all the required item's recipes as well.

[Recipes.md](Recipes.md)

All of the complicated recipes now have quests. You can craft a quest item that will start a quest chain which enables you to gather all of your materials upfront.

How do you find the quest item though? It's very simple, all you need to know is the name of the food you are trying to craft. If you search for Bolognese in the crafting menu, you will see both the food and quest items appear.

Complicated crafting is now much easier with these dynamic quests.

## Where do I get seeds?

Thats a wonderful question and appreciate that you asked.

Seeds for Farm Life are found just like vanilla seeds. You can loot them and buy them from traders. Trash piles, cupboards, and sinks are great places to look for them.

Once you have enough of the fruit or vegetable, you can craft them. For trees you MUST loot them or buy them though. Once you have acquired a tree seed, you will be able to easily increase your orchard though :)

There are two different quests you can complete to get plant and tree seeds. You just need one piece of coal and one piece of paper for each. Complete these quests and gain a Crate that you can place and smash for seeds:

- Farming Crops (Seeds)
- Growing Trees (Seeds)

These are completely optional. If you want to just scavenge like vanilla, you will find all the seed eventually :)

## How do pens work? I'm really confused!

I'm sorry for the confusion. Let me try to make it very simple.

First, there is a quest called 'The Basics: Livestock'. You can create the quest item and complete it for an in game walk through. Otherwise keep reading! (Please keep reading anyway, there are lots of things to learn here:)

To raise livestock you do the following.

- Craft a Pen
- Place the Pen on the ground (they do not stack on top of each other)
- Craft a "Pitch Fork"
- Make either "Cattle Feed" or "Chicken Feed" (depends on whether a pen or a coop)
- Equip the Pitch Fork and then "upgrade" the Empty Pen/Coop
- Wait for the critters to finish eating and growing
- Harvest with a Machete or Knife for best results

Hope that clears this up!

## What are these animals that look dead inside the pens?

For now there are very simple states for each stage of livestock.

- Laying down (looking dead) means the critters are hungry. You should feed them.
- If they have their head down then they are grazing, let them get full.
- When they are idling with their heads up, that means they are ready harvest.

## How do I make Beer, Wine, and Spirits (like Whiskey or Vodka)?

I'm glad that you have the same interests that I do when it comes to libations! I have a treat for you :)

Brewing, wine making, and distillation are a big part of Farm Life. There are two stations and 12 tools involved with crafting, as follows.

### Brew Cooker (hot, requires fuel)

- Masher
- Boiler
- Still

### Brew Station (cold, no fuel)

- Steeping Tun
- Malting Trays
- Wine Filter
- Carboy
- Wine Tank
- Spirits Vat
- Aged Oak Barrel
- Oak Barrel
- Charred Barrel
- Floor Corker
- Bottle Capper
- Mixing Cask

### Brew notes:

Brew is a very complicated process in real life. Farm Life is tries to pay tribute to the fact that brewing is complex yet rewarding. There are 3 major types of brewing categories in Farm Life; Beer (yes!), Spirits (think Scotch), and Wine (à la française).

### Beer

All good beer starts with, you guessed it, malts! While barley is the most common type of beer malt (and for good reason!), Farm Life deviates from this slightly.

#### Malting

Sorghum is the main grain used to create beer malts. Now I know you maybe upset by this if you are a brewer. In order to add variety to Farm Life, there are many things to grow. Sorghum is absolutely a viable malt for beer, though it is not common. In the apocalypse, everything has changed though, and now Sorghum is the beer masters grain champion.

Sorghum must be turned into malt. Which means it needs to be spouted and then stunted before it can be used for actual beer making. Farm Life emulates malting using a series of steps involving both the Brew Cook and the Brew station. There are 3 varieties of malts for beer.

- Light Malt
- Golden Malt
- Dark Malt

Just like in real life, different malts impart different effects on a brew. Each type of beer requires different types of malts.

#### Hopping

Once you have the correct malts, not it is time to get some hops! Farm Life uses the existing Hops Plant from vanilla, but adds 2 new types of hops.

- Floral Hops
- Bitter Hops

Different types of brews need different types of hops, again, just like in real life :)

#### The Brew

The once you have malt and hops, you are basically ready to start cranking out beers. I suggest you follow the in game quest for hints if you get lost, it is called 'The Brewing Method`.


### Spirits

Hard liquor has many varying and different paths from brewing beer. Vodka is relatively simple, while spirits like Scotch and Bourbon are much more complicated.

#### Malts

Some spirits require malts. There are two types of malts for spirits.

- Rye Malt
- Barley Malt

Barley Malt is a requirement (unlike beer) for many types of spirits, as is Rye Malt. You can not legally label or sell certain spirits if they do not meet specific requirements for the ingredients used to craft them. Beyond the now (in-game) non-existent law, there are many reasons why certain spirits use certain grains/malts: predominantly flavor.

I've tried to model the recipes for different types of spirits closely to their real world counter parts, and added in specific ingredients (i.e. Charred Barrel for Bourbon) for specific spirits. Feedback is always welcome!

### Wine

More notes soon ;)
